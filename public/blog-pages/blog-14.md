Painting also leaves you with the trouble of completely redoing the process again if you aren’t happy with the results the first time. Fortunately, there are plenty of interior design hacks to bring in color without using a single drop of paint.

**Wallpaper and wall decals**

Wallpapers are a popular interior design hack to add color to a room without painting it and the best part is, you aren’t left to deal with paint fumes or hours of drying time afterward! More or less, carefully applying wallpaper may be as tedious as successfully applying painter’s tape in a room, but wallpaper is temporary and doesn’t require touch-ups like painting a room would. If you ever get bored or want to change up your space, simply peel off the wallpaper and you’ll happily find that your walls remain in great condition. It’s the best way to commit to a color or pattern without the lengthy process of repainting if you change your mind later on. Additionally, wall decals are an excellent choice to add color without painting because it’s simple to apply and remove. The decals are designed to stick to the surface of your wall and intended to be a painless decorating process.
