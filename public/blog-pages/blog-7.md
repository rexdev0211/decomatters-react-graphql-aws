**Explore Your Uniqueness**

As you grow as an interior designer, you begin to discover your unique style and technique, and DecorMatters nurtures this growth in many ways. Sources of design inspiration include blogs, video blogs, decoration ideas for every type of room and style, and more. Our biggest goal is to provide these sources of inspiration and give our users the ability to simplify their home design experience. Along with this, to make it even easier for users to discover their preferred style, we recommend utilizing our filter feature, which allows users to filter their inspiration feed by style (modern, traditional, and industrial). This allows you not only to identify and understand more about each style and how others present it but also customize your feed specific to your wants and needs.

While everyone has their own unique creativity, being able to receive feedback from the community gives you the option to see and discover your own potential.
