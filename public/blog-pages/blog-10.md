**Let nature do its thing**

Nature is a beautiful thing and we need it, especially when sitting indoors at a desk all day. Utilizing plants to fill your empty desk space is a great way to decorate your office at work because it brings nature indoors and improves the air quality around you. Greenery also adds color to your office space and gives off relaxing and positive vibes, therefore, increasing your mood and productivity at work.

**Let the light in**

Sunlight is not only beneficial for plants, but for humans as well! Not only does natural lighting give you a boost of energy and put you in a better mood overall, but the daylight also provides extra light to brighten up your workspace. Good lighting, whether natural or artificial, is also essential to reduce eye strain from trying to work with low light.
