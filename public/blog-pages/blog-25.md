The rug layering trend has been a game-changer in modern home design, and we are here for it! For the uninitiated,  layering one rug on top of another might seem like a daring and crazy mixture of textures and patterns. Well, that’s exactly what it is! Layering one, two, or even three rugs doesn’t just make a room feel warmer and more welcoming, it also gives it some edge with a contrast of colors, designs, and textures. The more the merrier! You can go as crazy or as reserved as you want with it.

Still not convinced about the whole rug stacking, pattern-mixing, and color-contrasting trend? Don’t worry, we’ve come up with some suggestions on how to layer your rugs like a pro!

#### Ease Into It
Colors, patterns, textures—oh my! There really can be a lot to consider when layering rugs, and it can be very easy to overthink, well, everything. If you’re feeling overwhelmed or discouraged, ease into the process. 

Start with a neutral base rug that isn’t patterned or flashy. Now you can take a smaller, more textured or colorful rug to layer on top of the neutral one. Having a large neutral base with a small pop of color is a simple and harmless way to start. Ruggable’s Crosshatch Natural Rug or the Heathered Solid Dove Grey Rug makes for great rugs to use if you’re just starting out or going for a more simple layered look.

#### Be Bold
Some people take this as a chance to get a little crazy and explore their wild side! Feel free to mix different patterns, textures, and colors to see what works in your space. Layering rugs with different patterns is one of the quickest ways to add character to a living space. Choose patterned rugs that have the same color scheme and hues to ensure they work well together. For this, check out the Santa Fe Multicolor Rug or the Linear Aztec Black Rug to see what wild and brilliant designs you can create!

#### Consider Color
Colors can clash—that’s the last thing you want.  Not only do you have to find multiple rugs that go well together, but you also have to make sure those rugs coordinate with your entire room. 

 The solution is simple: tones. We recommend working with colors that have the same tone or intensity to ensure color coordination. This is a great way to tie the room together and create unity. This will also allow you to play with varying patterns with the same color story.

Or, consider taking a different route. A layered rug design that uses colors that contrast with the other colors of the room is definitely an eye-catching element. Try it out to see what kind of element you can bring to your home! Teal and magenta? Love!

#### Experiment With Placement

Now is the time to stray from structure and straight lines. Your rugs don’t need to be the same shape or be layered directly on top of one another. Turn them diagonally or let them hang off the edge! Doing this can bring attention to (or away from) a certain area of the room. Diagonal rugs are attention-grabbers and make a simple design more dynamic.

#### Play With Textures
Adding depth to a room can easily be done by rug layering. As Caitlin & Manda from The Merrythought say, “layering rugs is a great way to add more texture to a room, while also giving it a great cozy vibe.” Try silk,  jute, synthetic, sisal, cotton, or shag rugs. Nothing is off-limits!

Styling tip: adding a shag rug on top of any other textured rug is an easy way to bring a luxurious and cozy vibe to your home. Try putting a shag rug next to your bed and step into a soft, plush, magical wonderland. Keep it classy and go for a Polar White Shag Rug to make you feel a little extra fancy!
