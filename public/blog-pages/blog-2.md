So if you’re an interior design addict, or a tech savvy, you’ve probably heard of the news that Autodesk Homestyler products discontinued in early last year, 2017. Now you may want to search for some other alternatives to complete your design and decorating, but what is the ultimate choice to choose from hundreds of interior design apps? How would you know which app is the perfect one for you?

DecorMatters knows your concern, we now provide you some of the strongest key features we developed that make us unique and attractive to millions of users. Most importantly, besides being a free app, all the in-app services are free!

1. ARKit

With the update of iOS11 in 2017, Apple has introduced ARKit, a new framework that allows you to easily create augmented reality experiences for iPhone and iPad. By blending digital objects and information with the environment around you, ARKit takes apps beyond the screen, freeing them to interact with the real world in entirely new ways. In DecorMatters app, you can measure the sizes by ruler and capture picture of your room by camera at the same time, then put the furnitures into it to see if the sizes and styles match.
