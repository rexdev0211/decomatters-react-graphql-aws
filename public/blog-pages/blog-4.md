The first trend to be predicted in 2018 would be Wall Art. According to Pinterest, the pins for Wall Art related images have increased by a whooping 637% this year. Of course, bare walls are no fun - but it’s finally time to decorate your living space even more. Don’t be afraid to mix and match different mediums to allow for your personality to shine through your decorations. Wall art can definitely spruce up the entire look of your home, especially if you have a relatively simple and minimalistic design. Some great places to check out wall art would be Etsy, Society6, SaatchiArt and Urban Outfitters.

#### 2) PATTERNED PLANTS

Plants have always been a great way to revamp your living space to create a brighter, more attractive space - they can also help you sleep better, depending on the variety of the plant. However, how often have you given patterned plants a go? Just like how patterns on your couches, pillows, rugs, or throws have the ability to add a unique touch to your home, patterned plants can surely have the same effect! Check out Home Depot, Burpee, The Sill, and Monrovia to find which plants suit your current living situation the best!

#### 3) MIXING METALLICS

Silver, gold, or rose gold - whatever it may be, you have absolute free reign! For the longest time, mixing silver and gold was considered a fashion and design “sin.” However, the trend of mixed metallics has been slowly coming up on the rise, and has been predicted to be one of the biggest 2018 interior design trends. So, blend your warm and cool tones together to create more dimension and character to your home! It won’t hurt to experiment.
