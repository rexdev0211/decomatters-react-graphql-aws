**Industrial**

Similar to the rustic settings of a warehouse, factory, or urban loft, the Industrial interior design style celebrates the unfinished rawness and working parts of a building by incorporating that into the aesthetic of the design itself. Pieces commonly involved in creating the industrial look include exposed beams, ducts, columns, and pipes, which emphasize the rough but functional elements of this style that is predominantly labeled as a more ‘masculine’ approach to design. The color palette of this interior design style typically remains neutral, like grays and browns, because it blends well with the main features and iconic industrial looks of reclaimed wood elements, exposed brick walls, concrete floors, and leather, copper, and metal materials. If you aren’t shying away from the rawness and roughness and embrace the worn, recycled, and salvaged, you may find your interior design style for 2019 is perfectly captured by the industrial design style.

**Scandinavian**

The Scandinavian interior design style is simply serene. This popular interior design style is known for its simplicity, inspired by the lifestyle in Nordic countries, through its spacious interiors, natural lighting, minimal accessories, and functional furniture. Scandinavian interiors are minimal to a degree and maintain a careful balance between minimalism and being warm and personal. The furniture used in Scandinavian interior design often have a sculptural influence and feel like works of art while still remaining simple and fully functional. Although typically understated in a black, white, and gray color palette mixed with natural elements of wood, wide plank flooring, etc., Scandinavian styles incorporate hints of color in subtle ways through art, small throws or rugs, or single pieces of furniture.

**Modern**

Introduced at the rise of the 20th century, the Modernist style changed the way we viewed and deepened our appreciation of space and aesthetics. Modern architecture and design embrace the use of material, technology, and composition to create a sleek space. Simplicity is carefully composed throughout in all elements, including furniture, to emphasize the visual and functional effortlessness of this interior design style. Furthermore, the color palette of the modern interior design style remains simple along with the rest of the space. With a clean and straightforward approach, a Modern style is achieved with well-expressed crisp lines and geometry, a simple color scheme, and using materials such as metal, glass, and steel. This is the design style for your home if you want your space to celebrate natural materials, neutral or earthy colors, and elimination of unnecessary detailing.

**Zen**

The zen style brings the core principles and beliefs of traditional Japanese philosophy to life in a space that is all about balance, harmony, and consideration. Unlike other design styles that are hoping to make an impact with their distinct designs, fun furniture, or bold pieces, this interior design style is determined to bring peace and tranquility throughout the home anywhere and anytime. Typically making use of materials such as wood and natural fibers, every element, surface, and line of the zen interior design style is carefully thought out. The color palette often involves soft and natural tones intertwined with many elements of nature. The interiors of zen designs are very clean and minimal but uniquely designed and placed to make the most of the space. If you’re gravitating toward creating a space to truly bring you ease and comfort, you may find your interior design style is all about zen.

**Minimalist**

The minimalist interior design style is often mistaken as cold and uncomfortable because of its goal to strip things down to the bare basics, but contrary to popular belief, this effortlessly stunning interior design style has grown more popular throughout the years. Minimalism focuses on creating a beautiful space that is fuss-free, clean, and refined. It takes time and skill to achieve this style of living as everything is kept to a bare minimum and should serve more than one purpose. Concealed storage is essential in spaces like these where every detail matters and every piece of the design is reviewed for maximum use. If colors are incorporated, they are generally introduced in hushed tones, with an eye-catching accent or two. The minimalist style embraces more negative and open space with less clutter and adopts concepts of modern designs, but simplifies them further to create the minimalist vision.

**Traditional**

The traditional interior design style is one of the more popular design styles, yet one of the most commonly neglected ones. The traditional design appreciates antiques, classic art, symmetry, and rich designs with history. It’s a timeless go-to style because it’s a broad term to describe a style that incorporates multiple design styles and eras that aren’t committed to going in one particular direction. Generally originating from European homes and the comforts of classic European decor, some prominent qualities of the traditional design include dark wood, rich color, and ornate details. One of the most distinctive features of this interior design style is the symmetry in all elements of design, including sofas and lamps. Honoring the long, rich history of the past and mixing it with modern elements, this design style is a great route for all ages and personalities.

**Art Deco**

This style of interior design features a throwback to the epitome of chic in the 1920s. It’s perfect for someone with an out-of-the-box aesthetic that is ready to make a statement and push the boundaries of design, creating a space where a bold tiger or zebra print rug would fit right in. The art deco style embraces uniqueness and heavily features natural and geometric themes, typically including geometric shapes, chevron and zig-zag patterns, and stylized animal elements. Bold and bombastic is expressed through large furniture made of exotic woods, shiny chrome and mirrored elements, and angular patterns. The colors to achieve this interior design style are memorable and striking with a lot of contrasts, from bright yellows, reds, greens, blues, and pinks to silver, black, and chrome. If you’re daring enough to create a lively space that brings luxury, glamour, ornate and jewel-like vibes to the table, this is the interior design style for you.

Exemplary fixtures and accents include hanging barn doors, metal storage buckets, wooden mantels, and iron-inspired light fixtures.
