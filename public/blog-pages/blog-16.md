**Add a splash of color**

An obvious, but highly effective way of adding a splash of summer to your interior design is to bring in vibrant colors. Adding color through throw pillows, patterned throw blankets, lampshades, and furniture is a great way to make a space look more lively and bring the feel of summer into your home. To merge this summer interior design idea efficiently, it’s encouraged to use bright and bold colors, but pastels and matte finishes are also great options if you prefer more muted colors. Additionally, color can be showcased through bold art prints on the wall. To save money, you can print and frame photos from your favorite summer vacations to create an intriguing gallery wall. The photos are not only visually appealing, but they’re also on par with the summer theme.

**Neutral doesn’t mean dull**

Contrary to popular belief that adding pops of color is the quintessential way of bringing the feeling of summer into a home, a soft and neutral space can do so as well. Neutral does not always mean dull. The light and airy feeling of summer is easily expressed and achievable in a neutral space. Sometimes stepping away from adding color to every possible space can be refreshing because a clean and relaxed space can still present the happy feeling that color gives to a space. Incorporating white wood furniture is also an effective summer interior design idea because it helps a room feel breezy, summery, and lighter. One of the simplest and budget-friendly ways to adopt this neutral style is to convert your current furniture to white wood with paint or getting crafty with other simple DIY upgrades. If you’d prefer keeping your darker furniture the way it is, investing in white throws and pillows to place on sofas, chairs, and beds is a great way to brighten up your space.

**Simply add yellow**

Mixing in yellow tones in your summer interior design is an understated and simple way of adding a splash of summer into your space. Yellow is the epitome and unquestioned dominant color of every summer. From mustard to soft yellows, it is a color that will always bring positivity and joy to a space. If you want to manifest sunshine year round, painting a yellow accent wall or hanging large yellow prints are impactful ways to keep the feel of summer around. In addition, styling subtle hints of yellow throughout a space won’t go out of season or look out of place. If you’re looking to switch out your decor after summer, we suggest going for minimal splashes of yellow, such as a pillow, candle, vase, or side table that are easily switched out.
