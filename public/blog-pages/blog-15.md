Glam home decor comes together to create gorgeous spaces that advertise luxury, extravagance, and sophistication. Mirrored furniture, metallic accents, and chandeliers harmonize to make a room feel fit for royalty. With the expensive appearance of glam home decor, it may seem impossible to think about decorating on a budget to create a grand space you’ll love. However, making a room scream ‘glam’ without costing you thousands of dollars is absolutely doable.

**Keep it neutral or monochromatic**

A neutral or monochromatic color palette for your bases, such as couches and cabinets, is valuable in making your room appear larger and more spacious, which contributes to the extravagant style of glam. Soft pinks and multiple shades of white are used often to complement metallics while grays and creamy neutrals create a great base for a lavish look. A neutral or monochromatic base is not only helpful in matching well with glam home decor, but it is also beneficial for decorating on a budget because the neutral colors set a base that makes it easier for luxury details to pop. There’s a copious amount of neutral colored furniture to choose from and they’re generally cheaper than colored furniture, which is another reason why choosing neutral colors is a great way to save money.

**Take advantage of mirrored furniture**

Mirrored furniture is a glam home decor idea that will make you shine, literally. When decorating on a budget, a great tip is to shop for items that won’t suffocate your space and will add something valuable to your style and room. Mirrored furniture does just that for someone with a glam style. The reflective surfaces of mirrored furniture sprinkle your space with glamour while adding depth and shine to a room. From a floor length mirror to a mirrored cabinet or nightstand, this is the opportunity to take advantage of pieces that can make your space feel grander rather than spending on items that don’t add value to your space. For those decorating on an even tighter budget, a cheaper alternative is shopping for mirrored trays, candle holders, vases, and wall mirrors to help open and brighten up your space. You can find reasonably priced mirrored furniture and decor in stores like HomeGoods, T.J. Maxx, Ross, and Marshalls.

**Incorporate metallic accents**

A simple glam home decor idea is to play with and incorporate metallic accents. Gold and silver are the more common metallics used to represent glamour. Warm gold elegantly contrasts neutral bases whereas shiny silver accentuates a room with a subtle, soft sheen. Metallic accents are quick ways to make a room look more expensive and of high value. Affordable decorative accents stock the shelves in stores like HomeGoods, T.J.Maxx, and Urban Outfitters, which makes it easy to find a variety of pieces to add a little glam to your space. You can play around with displaying decorative sculptures and geometric accents to add personality, style, and uniqueness to a space.

**The small details that make a big difference**

One thing to keep in mind when shopping for glam home decor is that the little details matter. From boldly patterned rugs to shag rugs, a rug makes all the difference in making a space look and feel fancy. It’s important to consider the placement of the rug and compatibility of it with the rest of your glam home decor. Check out our guide to [choosing the right rug](https://decormatters.app/blog/12/home-design-tip-how-to-choose-the-right-rug-for-your-space) to help you find your perfect rug!

The key to creating a glam space is to trick the eyes into seeing high ceilings, even if you don’t have them. When decorating on a budget, purchasing tall curtains and hanging them really close to the ceiling makes any space look larger and gives the illusion of a high ceiling. Flowers, real or artificial, add elegance especially when kept monochromatic. Wall art, from black and white prints to bold paintings, are also nice finishing touches to add to your glam home decor. You can save money by hanging up your own artwork and painting your frames gold or silver to make them resemble high-end pieces.

Glamourous rooms are not typically cluttered and can look upscale without having a hundred things in it. The small details can add just the right amount of glamour needed, but the best part about decorating on a budget is that you can pick and choose pieces you feel you need most to organize your ideal glam space. You’d be surprised how many affordable items you can find at your local flea market and home decor stores if you spend some time searching. It’s a great way to save money and still be able to create a space you’ll love that looks more expensive than it actually was. Decorating on a budget to organize a glam space is possible!
