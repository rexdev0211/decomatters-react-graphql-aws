**Back to Basics: Backsplashes**

Kitchens are transforming in 2019, steering away from the monochrome kitchens with basic subway tiles to bolder patterned backsplashes that serve as fun focal points. This is the perfect trend for homeowners that are new to playing with bold colors or want to dabble in the use of patterns as backsplashes are subtle, yet impactful ways of making a statement. Fun and functional, backsplashes are a great take on an accent wall and add much-needed texture and color to some kitchen spaces.

**Dark and Bold Colors to Change Up the Mood**

Although Pantone’s Color of the Year for 2019 was announced as Living Coral, color experts revealed a color trend that they believed homeowners would be loving this year even more: dark and moodier colors. This includes shades such as navy, forest green, emerald green, and black. With white and bright colors dominating interior design trends in the last several years, this is a refreshing look and trend that can add depth to any room. This bold interior design trend can be showcased in a home through a painted room or accent wall and with accessories, but it is most commonly used sparingly as a statement piece or an accent.

**Create a Statement Ceiling**

When on the hunt for interior design trends and ideas, you’ll find that there’s a variety of ways to cover up or fill walls in your home, but the last place people think of designing is their ceiling. In 2019, creating a statement ceiling is a top priority to make a room appear bigger and brighter. Taking advantage of this unique accent wall will be the talk of your home design. You can make an impact on a room with this trend by painting the ceiling, covering the ceiling with wallpaper, or experimenting with molding to add dimension. Decorating the ceiling not only adds a ‘wow factor’ to a room, but it also helps balance out simpler walls and doesn’t overwhelm the rest of your decor.

**Bring In Bold Jewel Tones**

Goodbye minimalist, hello maximalist! Jewel tones are moving the interior design trends on from the minimalist grays and whites we love and are ready to embrace bold colors, patterns, and textures. This vibrant trend is most popular in 2019 for its deep rich jewel tones, such as indigo, emerald green, sapphire, and teal. Popularly expressed through velvet furniture or pillows and throws, it is easy to make any room pop with this interior design trend by mixing vibrant jewel-toned accents, rugs, decor, paint, and fabrics throughout a space.
