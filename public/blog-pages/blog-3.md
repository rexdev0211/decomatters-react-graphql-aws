“We are living in a time that requires inventiveness and imagination. It is this kind of creative inspiration that is indigenous to PANTONE 18-3838 Ultra-Violet, a blue-based purple that takes our awareness and potential to a higher level. From exploring new technologies and the greater galaxy, to artistic expression and spiritual reflection, intuitive Ultra Violet lights the way to what is yet to come.” said Leatrice Eiseman, Executive Director of the Pantone Color Institute.

Pantone as a global trend of the vane has always been influential in all walks of life.

So when ultra violet and interior design collide, what kind of sparks will be created?

Try implementing an ultra violet sofa if your house is currently in a European or Classical style. Velvet textured furniture can also bring about a noble and fancy feeling.

If you’ve already purchased the big centerpiece furniture, but still want to try something ultra violet, you still have options. Replacing or adding an ultra-violet carpet can enhance the feeling of royalty and elegance. Make sure your home has a simple color tone before you decide to add in bolder colors such as ultra-violet; otherwise, the colors will clash and be unpleasant to the eyes.

You can start experimenting with ultra-violet by replacing and switching out smaller objects. The color is bold enough to serve as accent decorations within the home.
