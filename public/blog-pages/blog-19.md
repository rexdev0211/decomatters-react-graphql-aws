**Declutter often**

If you find yourself rummaging through a pile of clothes on your chair for your next outfit or searching through an overcrowded bedroom for your keys, then you might want to reevaluate your room organization. Decluttering is one of the most efficient and obvious ways to consistently stay organized, but it’s one of the more difficult tasks to do continuously and to maintain. It’s easy to unintentionally collect unnecessary items or leave your stuff in random places and never get around to cleaning it. Spending time decluttering often and assessing the value of items that are forming clutter or hiding in cluttered spaces encourages you to keep things in your small bedroom to a minimum. A small bedroom can quickly become a mess if not routinely cleaned, especially where there’s space for things to pile up fast, like your work area, and [affect your productivity](https://decormatters.app/blog/9/office-decor-matters-how-to-decorate-a-productive-office-space). When going through the decluttering process, if you find things that you forget you had or question the purpose of, it’s probably not an item that you need or want to take up space in your bedroom. Once you’ve decluttered, it’s time to organize your bedroom by guaranteeing that everything has a home and a designated space to return to. The best thing about decluttering is that it’s the simplest way to organize a small bedroom on a budget because it’s free!

**Install floating shelves**

Floating shelves are an interior design hack not only for small spaces, but bigger ones as well because they open up any space and make them appear larger. In small bedrooms, it’s crucial to make the most of your space and installing floating shelves can be the perfect solution to increase storage and organization without sacrificing your style. Floating shelves are fairly inexpensive to purchase and install, making them a great interior design hack to organize a small bedroom on a budget. Shelves create new storage space to organize books, candles, and art prints and to display trinkets you love as decor. This is a great interior design hack to conceal storage because guests will see your floating shelves as a nice decor touch rather than an organizing method.

**Utilize hidden storage spaces**

Storage may not be the most glamorous part of a bedroom, but it can be well-hidden or shown off as part of your decor without people noticing the actual purpose of it. A rolling rack that is easily accessible by sliding in and out from under your bed is a great example of a way to disguise your storage. A rolling shoe rack is an ingenious way to store your shoe collection that may be inconveniently taking up space in your closet or on your open shoe rack in your bedroom. To maximize the space you have inside drawers and boxes, you can place dividers inside them to separate and neatly organize office supplies, miscellaneous items, sentimental pieces, and clothing.

A clever interior design hack is to purchase a nightstand that includes storage space to hold your bedside necessities and store your things that have no space to go, such as charger cables. It’s important to remember to limit what rests on top of the nightstand and resist the tendency to leave things there and allow clutter to form. Baskets are visually appealing and are great additions to bedroom decor, but they’re also useful to store items, such as extra blankets and pillows. To organize a small bedroom on a budget, it’s extremely important to take advantage of furniture with hidden storage or useful storage that can blend in without affecting your interior design aesthetic.
